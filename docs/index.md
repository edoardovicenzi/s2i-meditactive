# Welcome to MeditActive

Here you can find the official mantained documentation for the API.

To start head over the [Get Started](./installation.md) page.

The API is 100% RESTful-compliant so it is easy to navigate and use.

## Why MeditActive

I've always been interested in the meditation practice but it is a really difficult task to get into.

It requires a lot of discipline on the get-go, for most it is just a turnoff.

The answer is MeditActive!

The idea is create a habit that will benefit in the long run. With increasingly more challenging objectives until you become one with yourself.
